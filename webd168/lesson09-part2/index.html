              Hello! My name is Melissa and I'm going to tell you a little bit
              about me. This is my 2nd year of college, 1st year at Mesa
              College. I wanted to take this class because I took the previous
              one last time and it was fun! I hope to learn more from this class
              and use it frequently.
            </p>

              <h2 style="text-align: center;">More About Me</h2>
              I grew up in San Diego but was born in Wisconsin. Me and my family moved here when i was a baby. From the time i was 5 years old, I told my parents I always wanted to become a teacher. My first grade teacher inspired me to become a teacher because she was always kind, helpful and caring towards me and my classmates.

              <h2 style="text-align: center;">My family, work, etc</h2>
              I live with my family and my 16 year old cat. I am married and I
              work at a a high school with special needs kids. Although, my job
              can be tough at times, It's very rewarding. I am also pregnant and
              expecting my first baby in September! I am very nervous and
              excited at the same time.

              <h2 style="text-align: center;">My Goals</h2>
              Like others, I have goals and things I want to achieve. Sometimes
              I don't always get to achieve them but writing them down does help
              with making them a reality. Here are a few goals that I would like
              to or have already accomplished:
